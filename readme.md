## WireFraming

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual layout or blueprint of a website or mobile app before starting the actual design process. It involves sketching out the structure, content, and functionality of a digital product in a simplified, low-fidelity format.

The purpose of wireframing is to establish the basic structure of the digital product, including its features and user interface, without getting bogged down in the details of colors, fonts, and other visual elements.
